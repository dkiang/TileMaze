# TileMaze
Rotate the four quadrants of the screen to form different patterns.
This is a game/demo in which you control four quadrants of the screen using the arrow keys. The goal is, ultimately, to rotate the four quadrants either to form different designs, or to create sections of a maze. I haven't quite figured out which, just yet. For now, it's just a cool little demo of how you might go about manipulating various portions of the screen by applying rotational transformations. This was built off of Meggy_Rotate, another demo I did that rotates the entire screen by 90 degrees.
